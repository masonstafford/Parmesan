# Parmesan

This app, Parmesan, is a web application that’s purpose is to find the perfect recipe based off of the user’s search input, the user also has the option to have the health facts and ingredients read out to them if needed.

As a health conscious individual who cares about cooking at home, I often find it hard to search for a recipe because it’s time consuming and there are way too many options to pick from.
I want a web application that is simple and easy to use, so that I can find the joy in cooking.
Given I want to cook from home, I load up the Parmesan recipe website;
When I am ready to search for a recipe, I am greeted with a nice looking website
When I input my desired recipe into the search bar, a suggested recipe is generated.
When I scroll down to view my recipe, I see a picture, health and allergie facts,  I see a list of ingredients and the instructions.
